	  <table border> 
	    <tr>
	      <td style="color:blue;text-align:center">Brand</td>
	      <td>I have nothing but great things to say about KLASIKHZ. His real name is Iqwak Bhurji, and he is a recent graduate of UCSD (from a few years back).
	      He's pretty much the biggest name in Bolloywood-Bhangra style Indian music in the Nation, and you can hear his "Klasikhz Klasikhz" audio tag
	      in all of his mixes. It's extremely uniform - always the same audio tag - and the same goes for his logo (KLASIKHZ; it's been the same since day one).
	      I fortunately can say that his brandname, KLASIKHZ, is a perfect embodiment of himself as a person: words like <strong>bold</strong>, <strong>edgy</strong>,
	      and <strong>classy</strong> come to mind when you see his logo and the pictures he posts on his site. The name Klasikhz itself is a clever pun. He uses a ton of "classics" for his mixes
	      and he is Sikh by religion, hence the name Klasikhz. That in itself sort of shows how proud he is in his roots, and in combination with the edgy
	      graphics and pictures on his home page, portfolio page, and the individual track artwork featured in his albums (designed by his little brother),
	      lends website visitors a pretty good idea of what this guy is about. At the bottom of the page, there is a music player which showcases a song of his
	      upon arrival to the site. Within the first few seconds, you hear the famous "klasikhz Klasikhz" audio tag and you immediately know it's his song.
	      As mentioned before, his branding is extremely simplified (logo and audio tag), and you're not going to forget it or him.</td>

	    <tr>
	      <td style="color:blue;text-align:center">Functionality</td>
	      <td>I really don't have any complaints here. To return from any page to the home page, you just click on the huge and hard to miss KLASIKHZ logo at the top
	      of the page. The "About" page is simple - it includes a picture of himself and a bio, and the same for another guy who works with him. The Discography
	      tab sends you to a page with his released material/mixtapes/albums. Upon clicking any link, you get sent to a page which gives you the option to play any
	      individual track, or you can click a link that sends you to a page where you can download the entire album all at once. I was trying to link
	      the page that shows the individual tracks, their album artwork, and other related information because it's really well made and looks awesome,
	      but I just realized that navigating anywhere on the page doesn't change the URL in the address box of the browser. That seems to be a problem,
	      especially if I want to be able to share a particular part of the site with a friend. Also, when clicking the "download album" button, an error comes
	      up if you didn't enter your name and e-mail address. That, for some, may also be a problem. </td>
