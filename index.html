	    <tr>
	      <td style="color:blue;text-align:center">Brand</td>
	      <td>I have nothing but great things to say about KLASIKHZ. His real name is Iqwak Bhurji, and he is a recent graduate of UCSD (from a few years back).
	      He's pretty much the biggest name in Bolloywood-Bhangra style Indian music in the Nation, and you can hear his "Klasikhz Klasikhz" audio tag
	      in all of his mixes. It's extremely uniform - always the same audio tag - and the same goes for his logo (KLASIKHZ; it's been the same since day one).
	      I fortunately can say that his brandname, KLASIKHZ, is a perfect embodiment of himself as a person: words like bold, edgy, and classy come to mind
	      when you see his logo and the pictures he posts on his site. The name Klasikhz itself is a clever pun. He uses a ton of "classics" for his mixes
	      and he is Sikh by religion, hence the name Klasikhz. That in itself sort of shows how proud he is in his roots, and in combination with the edgy
	      graphics and pictures on his home page, portfolio page, and the individual track artwork featured in his albums (designed by his little brother),
	      lends website visitors a pretty good idea of what this guy is about. At the bottom of the page, there is a music player which showcases a song of his
	      upon arrival to the site. Within the first few seconds, you hear the famous "klasikhz Klasikhz" audio tag and you immediately know it's his song.
	      As mentioned before, his branding is extremely simplified (logo and audio tag), and you're not going to forget it or him.</td>
