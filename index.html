	  <table border> 
	    <tr>
	      <td style="color:blue;text-align:center">Brand</td>
	      <td>I have nothing but great things to say about KLASIKHZ. His real name is Iqwak Bhurji, and he is a recent graduate of UCSD (from a few years back).
	      He's pretty much the biggest name in Bolloywood-Bhangra style Indian music in the Nation, and you can hear his "Klasikhz Klasikhz" audio tag
	      in all of his mixes. It's extremely uniform - always the same audio tag - and the same goes for his logo (KLASIKHZ; it's been the same since day one).
	      I fortunately can say that his brandname, KLASIKHZ, is a perfect embodiment of himself as a person: words like <strong>bold</strong>, <strong>edgy</strong>,
	      and <strong>classy</strong> come to mind when you see his logo and the pictures he posts on his site. The name Klasikhz itself is a clever pun. He uses a ton of "classics" for his mixes
	      and he is Sikh by religion, hence the name Klasikhz. That in itself sort of shows how proud he is in his roots, and in combination with the edgy
	      graphics and pictures on his home page, portfolio page, and the individual track artwork featured in his albums (designed by his little brother),
	      lends website visitors a pretty good idea of what this guy is about. At the bottom of the page, there is a music player which showcases a song of his
	      upon arrival to the site. Within the first few seconds, you hear the famous "klasikhz Klasikhz" audio tag and you immediately know it's his song.
	      As mentioned before, his branding is extremely simplified (logo and audio tag), and you're not going to forget it or him.</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	      <td style="color:blue;text-align:center">Functionality</td>
	      <td>I really don't have any complaints here. To return from any page to the home page, you just click on the huge and hard to miss KLASIKHZ logo at the top
	      of the page. The "About" page is simple - it includes a picture of himself and a bio, and the same for another guy who works with him. The Discography
	      tab sends you to a page with his released material/mixtapes/albums. Upon clicking any link, you get sent to a page which gives you the option to play any
	      individual track, or you can click a link that sends you to a page where you can download the entire album all at once. I was trying to link
	      the page that shows the individual tracks, their album artwork, and other related information because it's really well made and looks awesome,
	      but I just realized that navigating anywhere on the page doesn't change the URL in the address box of the browser. That seems to be a problem,
	      especially if I want to be able to share a particular part of the site with a friend. Also, when clicking the "download album" button, an error comes
	      up if you didn't enter your name and e-mail address. That, for some, may also be a problem. On his portfolio page, you can see all the Universities/Teams
	      he's made mixes for in the past. Upon clicking any team, you're sent to a page which includes a blurb from the captain of that team, a blurb from
	      Klasikhz about the experience he had working on that mix witht that team, a sidebox for easy downloading of the mix(es), the location of the team,
	      a picture of the team, and featured video of the team. Clicking any of the links fades the background and pulls up a new frame on top of the
	      existing page. It makes for fast viewing, and returning to the page you were at earlier is as simple as clicking the "x" on the new media frame.
	      His Downloads page has a nice table for "recently added" and "most popular," as well as a link to "all downloads." His contact page is pretty nice,
	      and it has a link back to his services page that goes directly to his "Booking Request" page. Over all, I can easily find my way around and everything
	      works pretty well.</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	      <td style="color:blue;text-align:center">Interactivity</td>
	      <td>The main page has a <strong>banner/slider</strong> of some sort, which on a timed interval rotates through a few images. At the bottom left of the
	      page, there's a
	      <strong>twitter</strong> feed that gets updated whenever someone posts to/about him or his page. At the bottom right of the page is a <strong>Facebook</strong> feed that shows which of
	      the viewer's friends has "liked" KLASIKHZ. It also provides a link to his facebook page. His new album "For the Record" was recently released and
	      there was a <strong>live countdown counter</strong> (days, hours, minutes, seconds) until the release of the album. The <strong>SCM Music Player</strong> is imbedded at the bottom
	      of the page and plays one of his songs when you arrive on the page. You have full control over what song you want to play (which can be accessed
	      by clicking on the "playlist" icon at the bottom right of the music bar, and you also have control over the volume, etc. Finally, the contact page
	      has <strong>fill-in sections</strong> for Name, E-Mail, Subject, etc. Before you can submit, there's an <strong>img captcha</strong> mechanism that's been put into place. As for any
	      filtering, the only type of filtering you can do is "by team" on the portfolio page, which is sort of built in to the way people search for
	      mixes. On the downloads page, as mentioned above, there's a "most popular" and "recently added" section, as well as a "all downloads" link. It would
	      be awesome if you could search mixes for specific artists, but that's a rather unrealistic amount of work for KLASIKHZ to go through considering there
	      are tons of artists featured in any given mix. In addition, people don't usually search for remixes like that anyway. </td>

	      <td>I think I covered a lot of the actual navigating stuff in my Functionality section above, but to add to that stuff, it's pretty simple to see
	      where on the site you're at. The home page is pretty distinct and easy to remember, so you know when you're on that. At the top of every subpage,
	      there's a header (which should be a bit bigger or bolder) showing which page you're on. Slightly above that header on every page is a small Nav bar
	      which has a link to Home. Interestingly enough, if you click on another subpage link on one of the main subpages, the option to go back one page to
	      the main subpage disappears. All that's left is the sub-subpage link (the page you're currently on) and the link to the homepage.</br>

	      Only problem I see in navigation is that some sub-pages, ie the Home>Discography>"Any Subsequent Subpage" has a different navigation bar up on the top.
	      It's not so much a problem in Interactivity as it is a problem in consistency.</br>
