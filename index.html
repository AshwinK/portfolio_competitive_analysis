	      <td>The only words that really come to mind are <strong>colorful</strong>, for the bright colors of the socks, and <strong>funky</strong> because of the
	      positioning of the person's legs - it makes it look like she needs to go to the restroom. That, or the person is extremely shy. Either way, in my opinion,
	      it's not clear or great branding by any means. The page is <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>organized</strong>, but that may be attributed to
	      either the fact that the designer likes simplicity and organization, or the fact that it's just a really boring layout. </td>

	    <tr>
	      <td style="color:blue;text-align:center">Functionality</td>
	      <td>I don't really like this site's functionality too much, becuase there really isn't much. For a person who's been in the trade for seven years
	      (at the time of making this portfolio/page), I expect a lot more. First of all, the <strong>thumbnails of the portfolio pieces are incredibly small
	      </strong>. Above each piece is a <strong>small caption which says either "web, logo, icon, or char."</strong> I had to guess that char meant character too.
	      What's worst is that the <strong>captions aforementioned are so small and in such a hard-to-read script</strong> that I got really annoyed. When you
	      click on one of the portfolio pieces, a pop-up of that piece comes up for full viewing, not in a separate window. That's not so bad, but I found
	      an error with the first piece on the page. What seems to say "LOADING" is still partially visible behind the fully-loaded image.<br/>
	      <img class="span12"; src="screenshots/emotions1.png"/><br/>
	      As a final critique, there's only twleve images on show at a time, and there's some small left and right arrows (see screenshot of site) to navigate
	      to more portfolio pieces. It's simple, and works, but I'd prefer a system that shows <strong>less and larger images per page</strong> (perhaps even on
	      another linked page instead of the home portfolio page). On a final note, when the portfolio piece pops up after it's been clicked, the user finds out
	      shortly that the image popping up is merely an image and isn't linked to the actual site. You have to <strong>manually copy-paste</strong> into a new
	      tab/window to visit that site. Most annoying of all is that you can't right click images or pop-ups after you click on a portfolio piece.<br/>

	      pieces that allow you to navigate back and forth. There is absolutely <strong>no method of filtering</strong>, and you're restricted to viewing twelve
	      super small images at a time. From just clicking once or twice (left or right) on the arrows, you get the feeling, "I don't know when this is going to end
	      or how many more portfolio pieces there are," which is annoying. It's rather simple, and there's no animation at all. Sometimes, if the page isn't loading
	      fast enough, you momentarily see a "no picture" sign replacing every portfolio piece, or at least in the space where the piece should be.

	      up and you can simply close that tab to get back to viewing what you were just looking at - nothing too fancy, no back button required, etc. That's about
	      the only plus. Since the only thing that is changing on the site at all are the portfolio pieces currently being shown before/after you click an arrow
	      key, you don't really have to know where you are. Within the portfolio pieces as a whole, you have to keep mental note of "where you're at" in terms of
	      toward the beginning or the end in order to go back to a piece you looked at before (because there's no filtering mechanism).

	      <td>I have nothing but great things to say about KLASIKHZ. His real name is Iqwak Bhurji, and he is a recent graduate of UCSD (from a few years back).
	      He's pretty much the biggest name in Bolloywood-Bhangra style Indian music in the Nation, and you can hear his "Klasikhz Klasikhz" audio tag
	      in all of his mixes. It's extremely uniform - always the same audio tag - and the same goes for his logo (KLASIKHZ; it's been the same since day one).
	      I fortunately can say that his brandname, KLASIKHZ, is a perfect embodiment of himself as a person: words like <strong>bold</strong>, <strong>edgy</strong>,
	      and <strong>classy</strong> come to mind when you see his logo and the pictures he posts on his site. The name Klasikhz itself is a clever pun. He uses a ton of "classics" for his mixes
	      and he is Sikh by religion, hence the name Klasikhz. That in itself sort of shows how proud he is in his roots, and in combination with the edgy
	      graphics and pictures on his home page, portfolio page, and the individual track artwork featured in his albums (designed by his little brother),
	      lends website visitors a pretty good idea of what this guy is about. At the bottom of the page, there is a music player which showcases a song of his
	      upon arrival to the site. Within the first few seconds, you hear the famous "klasikhz Klasikhz" audio tag and you immediately know it's his song.
	      As mentioned before, his branding is extremely simplified (logo and audio tag), and you're not going to forget it or him.</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	      <td style="color:blue;text-align:center">Functionality</td>
	      <td>I really don't have any complaints here. To return from any page to the home page, you just click on the huge and hard to miss KLASIKHZ logo at the top
	      of the page. The "About" page is simple - it includes a picture of himself and a bio, and the same for another guy who works with him. The Discography
	      tab sends you to a page with his released material/mixtapes/albums. Upon clicking any link, you get sent to a page which gives you the option to play any
	      individual track, or you can click a link that sends you to a page where you can download the entire album all at once. I was trying to link
	      the page that shows the individual tracks, their album artwork, and other related information because it's really well made and looks awesome,
	      but I just realized that navigating anywhere on the page doesn't change the URL in the address box of the browser. That seems to be a problem,
	      especially if I want to be able to share a particular part of the site with a friend. Also, when clicking the "download album" button, an error comes
	      up if you didn't enter your name and email address. That, for some, may also be a problem. On his portfolio page, you can see all the Universities/Teams
	      he's made mixes for in the past. Upon clicking any team, you're sent to a page which includes a blurb from the captain of that team, a blurb from
	      Klasikhz about the experience he had working on that mix witht that team, a sidebox for easy downloading of the mix(es), the location of the team,
	      a picture of the team, and featured video of the team. Clicking any of the links fades the background and pulls up a new frame on top of the
	      existing page. It makes for fast viewing, and returning to the page you were at earlier is as simple as clicking the "x" on the new media frame.
	      His Downloads page has a nice table for "recently added" and "most popular," as well as a link to "all downloads." His contact page is pretty nice,
	      and it has a link back to his services page that goes directly to his "Booking Request" page. Over all, I can easily find my way around and everything
	      works pretty well.</td>

	      <td style="color:blue;text-align:center">Interactivity</td>
	      <td>The main page has a <strong>banner/slider</strong> of some sort, which on a timed interval rotates through a few images. At the bottom left of the
	      page, there's a
	      <strong>twitter</strong> feed that gets updated whenever someone posts to/about him or his page. At the bottom right of the page is a <strong>Facebook
	      </strong> feed that shows which of
	      the viewer's friends has "liked" KLASIKHZ. It also provides a link to his facebook page. His new album "For the Record" was recently released and
	      there was a <strong>live countdown counter</strong> (days, hours, minutes, seconds) until the release of the album. The <strong>SCM Music Player</strong>
	      is imbedded at the bottom
	      of the page and plays one of his songs when you arrive on the page. You have full control over what song you want to play (which can be accessed
	      by clicking on the "playlist" icon at the bottom right of the music bar, and you also have control over the volume, etc. Finally, the contact page
	      has <strong>fill-in sections</strong> for Name, E-Mail, Subject, etc. Before you can submit, there's an <strong>img captcha</strong> mechanism that's been
	      put into place. As for any
	      filtering, the only type of filtering you can do is "by team" on the portfolio page, which is sort of built in to the way people search for
	      mixes. On the downloads page, as mentioned above, there's a "most popular" and "recently added" section, as well as a "all downloads" link. It would
	      be awesome if you could search mixes for specific artists, but that's a rather unrealistic amount of work for KLASIKHZ to go through considering there
	      are tons of artists featured in any given mix. In addition, people don't usually search for remixes like that anyway. </td>

	      is metallic, sharp, and crisp. It also matches the color of the script, and coincidentally, the color of the car on slide one of the large feature-
	      photo banner. That uniformity tells me that the car line is probably very unique and has a special design that is pervasive througout all the different

	      <br/> <img class="span12"; src="screenshots/infiniti2.png"/><br/>
	      The "Infiniti Models" dropdown is even cooler because when you scroll over any model car, a new description and picture for that model shows up.<br/>

	      when you hover over them, which makes browsing really easy. The "Infiniti Models" dropdown allows you to scroll over different cars just by using your mouse
	      and doesn't require you to "scroll" with a mouse or to drag a scrollbar, which is kind of neat. Just like with the "What's Inside" links, you're redirected
	      upon clicking any car model to its own home site. That just goes to show that the original home page has been <strong>optimized</strong> for showcasing
	      all that Infiniti has to offer without plaguing its viewers with excess information and selling points. As mentioned above, you can pause the banner videos
	      or change the multimedia being shown at any time, which is also kind of nice.

	      dropdown, so you're back to the page as soon as you mouse off the dropdown tab. When you click on the links that send you to different web pages, there's no
	      real need to navigate back to the original page as it is meant to be a starting point for your INFINITI shopping/learning experience. However, you can
	      always "back" click all the way to it if you'd like. The Infiniti logo at the top actually redirects you to the global INFINITI page, where you have even
	      more option. That is the only flaw, becuase the only easy way to get to this site is by googling "Infiniti" and clicking the first link.

	      functional in that you can choose to view the different type of work she has. Also, the arrow buttons to navigate the material are accompanied
	      by "next and previous page" captions, which make things a lot clearer. In addition, you can see in this screenshot that the viewer is on page 1-of-2,
	      and that's extremely helpful.<br/>
